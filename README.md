# Outremer - Exploration Age Civilization
Official releases hosted on ![Civfanatics](https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/tcs-outremer-exploration.32002/).

NOTE: This is an alpha release, with several unfinished parts due to current modding limitations.
* Unique units and infrastructure use fallback models - we do not yet have access (or have not figured out how) to define models yet
* I have not yet figured out how to add custom unit icons to the Tech tree

## Design
I wanted to avoid a meme approach to Outremer which focused on bonuses against other religions. Outremer's history and context is fascinating, and it's far more interesting to try and reflect the circumstances of its creation and existence in the design.
